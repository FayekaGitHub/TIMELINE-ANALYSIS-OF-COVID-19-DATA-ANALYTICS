### OVERVIEW
In my Power BI dashboard for COVID-19 Timeline analysis of world data, I've utilized a variety of charts to effectively visualize different aspects of the pandemic. The dashboard includes visualizations for total deaths, new cases, vaccination progress, and the number of hospitalized and ICU patients. Each chart is designed to provide clear insights into these key metrics, helping users understand trends, patterns, and the overall impact of the pandemic. Interactive features allow for a deeper exploration of the data, making it easier to analyze and interpret the evolving situation globally.
